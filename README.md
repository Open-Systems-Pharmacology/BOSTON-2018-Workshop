# BOSTON-2018-Workshop (SHORT NOTICE!!!)

## PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® workshop on integrating PBPK with QSP 

esqLABS is running a one-day hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshop on **integrating PBPK with QSP** on **Wednesday 27 June** at the **OFICIO Fenway Meeting Room** in **Boston**, MA on US East Coast. The workshop covers the concepts and application of combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:

- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Integrate mechanism-based pharmacodynamics in MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in R

This workshop will be held by the lead scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

The workshop is currently restricted to 25 participants.

## AGENDA

As a use-case for above learnings, we will develop a PB-QSP model for naked antibody pre-treatment (nAb) for antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) treatment of tumor growth, in detail:
